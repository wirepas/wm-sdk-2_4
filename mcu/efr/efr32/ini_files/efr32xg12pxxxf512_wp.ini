; Memory areas where the bootloader is allowed write
;
; The bootloader erases an area completely before writing to it, even if data
; from scratchpad does not fill the area entirely. It is possible to define
; overlapping areas, to update only the application code but not its data, for
; example.
;
; There is room for 8 or 16 areas depending on whether the bootloader uses
; symmetric or public key scratchpad signing respectively. Area IDs where the top
; bit (bit 31) is zero are reserved for Wirepas use.
;
; Flags definition:
; bit 0 : store version numbers in this area
; bit 1 : memory area is located in external flash
; bits 2,3,4 : area type, 0:bootloader, 1:stack, 2:application, 3:persistent, 4:scratchpad, 5:user, 6:modemfw
